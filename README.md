# Object-Oriented Programming in Java
The four codebase are projects that excercised my learnings in Java. 

Each project has their own `README.md` that specifies what it does and how to set it up on your device. 

For further information, there is an `Instructions.pdf` of the assignment instructions, what the code is meant to do, and what I've specifically written.
