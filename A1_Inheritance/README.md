# What this code does
I created two Robots deriving from the Robot Class: PowerBot and NinjaBot. Their main purpose is to fight. Using `RobotCombat`, you can specify their values and watch them fight

# Setup
In Command Line / Terminal, run `javac RobotCombat.java && java RobotCombat`. This should be the following output:
```
Now fighting: Super Droid vs. Ninja Sakura
Super Droid strikes hard!
Ninja Sakura takes a damage of 10!
Ninja Sakura hides itself from attacks!
Ninja Sakura launches an attack!
Super Droid takes a damage of 10!
Super Droid boosts itself!
Super Droid makes a heavy strike!
Ninja Sakura hides from the attack!
Ninja Sakura launches an attack!
Super Droid takes a damage of 10!
Ninja Sakura wins!
