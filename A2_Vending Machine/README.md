# What this code does
I created an interface for a Vending Machine that doesn't scam. You can buy Pepsi or CocaCola.

# Setup
In Command Line / Terminal, run `javac Main.java && java Main`.

You may type any of the four prompts:
1. Insert \[10/5/2/1\] – Insert a number of coins
2. Reject – Make the Vending Machine give back all your coins
3. Buy \[Pepsi/CocaCola\] – Buy a Pepsi ($5) or CocaCola ($4), Includes Change.
4. Exit – Terminate the program
